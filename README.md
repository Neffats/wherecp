# wherecp

## Description
Wherecp is (or will be) a vendor agnostic repository of firewall rules, allowing users to easily (hopefully) query via a web ui or the REST api.

The idea is that the app will pull all of the objects from the firewalls and translate them into uniform data types, allowing us to interrogate everything in one place.
